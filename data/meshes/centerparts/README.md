If you design your part (connector), you should add your part's files in this folder.

For a connector you should provide:
1. A surface mesh in the `stl` format for the visualization.
2. A volume mesh in the `vtk` format, if you want to use the `tetra` model (deformable option).
3. A `json` file defining the positions and orientations for attaching the legs.
