You should add your centerparts file in this folder.

For a leg you should provide:
1. A surface mesh in the `stl` format for the visualization.
2. A volume mesh in the `vtk` format, if you want to use the `tetra` model.
3. A `txt` file with coordinates in the format [x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw], if you want to use the `beam` and `cosserat` models.
